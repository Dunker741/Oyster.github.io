      The public introduction of Mr. Spock in 1966 has had a profound impact in America, 
      but not nearly as much as it did on the as yet undefined sector of the population 
      having a condition known as Asperger's syndrome.  Although we comprise less than half of one percent of the population, 
      our absence from history would most certainly have significant negative effects on the alternate universe that would be created, especially with the loss of people such as Newton, Tesla, and Gates.  Some consider our mental difference so drastic we represent a subspecies resulting from evolutionary processes.  Many of us often feel that we were born on the wrong planet, thus our affinity for the <em>Star Trek</em> universe.  Our purpose in sending this letter, specifically in reference to the previous sentence, a more official relationship with those who own the patents, trademarks, and copyrights associated with <em>Star Trek</em>.

    We could, as an overlooked minority with a higher than average percentage of science fiction aficionados, 
    remain contentedly as an unassuming part of a fan base; however, attempts to help integrate us into the extant 
    neurotypically dominated world have had serious deleterious consequences for us.  
    Current well-meaning educators have included us in special education programs that seek to transform us into "normal"
    human beings-a normality we cannot ever share.  We do not think the same, learn the same, share the same social skills, goals, or priorities.  
    We also do not have the ability to express our emotions in a neurotypical way.  After struggling through the extant educational systems, over seventy-five percent
    of us are not fully employed and of those of us who graduate from college, eighty-five percent are unemployed.  
    Because we are twice as likely to be overweight, more likely to suffer from depression and higher suicide rates, 
    we have a life expectancy sixteen years less than the national average.  Of course, society will always have square pegs
    that do not fit in round holes, but with respect to Aspens not fitting in, society is the greater loser because 
    of the repression of the many gifts our small group has to offer.

    <h1>Asperger's By The Numbers</h1>
      <p class="statistics">Aspens make up only <strong>0.5%</strong> of the world's population. 
        Yet <strong>85%</strong> of us are <strong>unemployed</strong>. Even if we hold a college degree, 
        <strong>75%</strong> will still be <strong>without a job</strong>. 
        We are <strong>2 times</strong> more likely to be <strong>overweight</strong>. 
        With higher rates of <strong>depression</strong> and <strong>suicide</strong>.
        These factors combine to give us a life expectancy <strong>16 years less</strong> than the national average.</p>

      Despite our recent relegation to the autism spectrum (along with the assertions that we have an unwanted disorder, disability, 
      or disease) most of us Aspens like who and what we are.  Most of us have the ability to think outside the box, 
      see patterns others fail to see, come up with ingenious solutions, and dedicate incredible focus to solving problems, puzzles 
      and mysteries.  By definition, we have above-average IQs, with an estimated median IQ of 121 and a distribution strongly 
      positively skewed into intelligence considered genius.
      Our goal at Aspen Academy is to create a complete student-paced educational program that not only satisfactorily meets 
      established educational standards, but also promotes student self-awareness, self-discipline, competent skills in non-verbal 
      communication with neurotypicals, self-expression in visual and performing arts, effective emotion management, optimal time 
      and health management, and preparation for careers in the plethora of new frontiers in technology.  Our program is dedicated 
      to providing the students with skills for the future instead of educating them for a world that no longer exists.

    <p class="description">
      Our mission is to prepare Aspen students for life on this plane through appropriate training in life skills and targeted preparation based on individual career interests and talents.
      We are convinced space travel and exploration will expand sooner than later, and we would greatly benefit by preparing
      for that eventuality.  We believe a non-fictional Star Fleet Academy will exist before the end of the century.  
      In fact, we would like to be the ones to establish the academy with our boarding school dedicated to that segment of the 
      population with Asperger's.  
      In summary, this is an exploratory letter for the potential of establishing a working relationship 
      (licensing, sponsorship, or partnership) with your organization.    
      Our primary purpose is to be of benefit to the Asperger community, while we recognize that any association with your 
      organization would, at a minimum, provide you with positive public relations.  We look forward to future correspondence from you.
